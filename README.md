## TODO

- [x] jest tests
- [x] don't include node_modules in electron builds
- [ ] look into electron-builder for multi platform builds
- [ ] hot reloading sagas/reducers
- [ ] electron cross process communication (https://github.com/samiskin/redux-electron-store)
- [ ] provide stack examples + installation
- [x] iterate over dev dependencies instead of using explicit vendors.js
- [ ] Deployment guides
- [x] better build logs (https://github.com/ngryman/speedracer for insp.)
- [x] add electron react/redux devtools
